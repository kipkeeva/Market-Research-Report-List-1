<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Aircraft Cooling Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Air Cycle Air Conditioning</li><li>Vapor Cycle Air Conditioning</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Aircraft cooling systems include two main types: air cycle air conditioning and vapor cycle air conditioning. Air cycle air conditioning systems work by using engine air to cool the cabin, removing heat through an air cycle machine. On the other hand, vapor cycle air conditioning systems use a refrigerant to cool the cabin air, with heat being rejected to the ambient air or absorbed by a heat sink. Both systems play a crucial role in maintaining comfortable temperature and humidity levels inside the aircraft cabin.</p></p>
