<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Enclosed Screw Pumps Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single Screw</li><li>Multi-screw</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The enclosed screw pumps market comprises two main types: single screw and multi-screw pumps. Single screw pumps consist of a helical rotor inside a double helical rubber stator, creating a continuous flow of liquid. They are commonly used for applications involving low to medium viscosity fluids. On the other hand, multi-screw pumps have two or more screws that intermesh and rotate in a tight synchronous manner, providing a high-pressure capability. These pumps are suitable for handling high viscosity fluids and are often found in industries requiring precise metering or high efficiency.</p></p>
