<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Airport De-icing Vehicles Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Spreader</li><li>Sprayer</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The airport de-icing vehicles market consists of two main types: spreaders and sprayers. Spreaders are vehicles designed to distribute de-icing materials, such as sand or granular ice melt, onto airport surfaces. They have a hopper that holds the de-icing material and a spreading mechanism that evenly disperses it. Sprayers, on the other hand, are vehicles equipped with tanks and nozzles that spray liquid de-icing agents, like glycol-based solutions, onto aircraft surfaces. This helps to remove ice and prevent further accumulation during winter weather conditions.</p></p>
