<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Gravity Retaining Wall Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Oblique</li><li>Pitching</li><li>Upright</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Gravity retaining walls are a type of structure used to hold back soil and prevent erosion. They rely on their own weight to resist the pressure exerted by the soil behind them. There are three main types of gravity retaining walls: oblique, pitching, and upright. Oblique walls are inclined and provide a sloping face, ideal for landscapes with a gentle slope. Pitching walls have a series of steps that slope inward, creating a staircase-like appearance. Upright walls are vertical and provide a straight face, making them suitable for areas that require maximum stability.</p></p>
