<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Stimulation Additives Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Inhibitors</li><li>Stabilizers</li><li>Others</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The stimulation additives market is categorized into three types: inhibitors, stabilizers, and others. Inhibitors are substances used in the process of stimulation to prevent or minimize undesirable reactions. They work by inhibiting the activity of certain chemicals or elements. Stabilizers, on the other hand, are additives that help maintain the stability and consistency of the stimulation process, preventing any changes or disruptions. The "others" category includes additional additives with unique functions that are not classified as inhibitors or stabilizers.</p></p>
