<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The FPC Tester Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Without Refrigerating Machine</li><li>With Refrigerating Machine</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The FPC Tester Market is categorized into two types based on the presence or absence of a refrigerating machine. In the first type, without a refrigerating machine, the tester does not come equipped with a cooling system and operates at ambient temperature. This type of tester is suitable for testing flexible printed circuits (FPCs) in normal temperature environments. In the second type, with a refrigerating machine, the tester includes a cooling system to maintain a specific low temperature during testing. This type is designed for FPCs that require testing under controlled cold conditions.</p></p>
