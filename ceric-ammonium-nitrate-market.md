<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Ceric Ammonium Nitrate Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Neutralization Method</li><li>Conversion Method</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Ceric Ammonium Nitrate (CAN) is a versatile substance used in various industries. The market types of CAN can be categorized into two methods: neutralization and conversion. In the neutralization method, CAN is produced by reacting cerium oxide with ammonium nitrate solution. This process creates a highly pure product suitable for specific applications like pharmaceuticals and catalysis. The conversion method involves the direct conversion of cerium nitrate hexahydrate with ammonium nitrate, resulting in CAN with lower purity but broader applications in laboratories and industrial settings. Both methods cater to different market demands and serve specific purposes.</p></p>
