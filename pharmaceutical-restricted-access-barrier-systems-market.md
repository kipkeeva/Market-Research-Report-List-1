<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Pharmaceutical Restricted Access Barrier Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Closed Type</li><li>Open Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Pharmaceutical Restricted Access Barrier Systems (RABS) refer to safety solutions that provide a controlled environment to handle sensitive pharmaceutical processes. Closed-type RABS enclose the operating area completely, ensuring isolation from external contaminants. This system typically employs glove ports and isolators for handling operations. Open-type RABS, on the other hand, provide a physical barrier but allow airflow exchange with the surrounding environment. This system often uses a combination of barriers like curtains, shields, or air handling units to maintain cleanliness. Both types aim to minimize contamination risks and enhance the safety of pharmaceutical manufacturing processes.</p></p>
