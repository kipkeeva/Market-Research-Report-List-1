<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Polymer Based Solubility Enhancement Excipients Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Solid Dispersion</li><li>Particle Size Reduction</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Polymer Based Solubility Enhancement Excipients Market includes two main types: Solid Dispersion and Particle Size Reduction. Solid Dispersion refers to a technique where a poorly soluble drug is dispersed in a polymer matrix to improve its solubility and bioavailability. This method promotes the dissolution of drugs, making them more effective. On the other hand, Particle Size Reduction involves reducing the particle size of a drug to enhance its solubility and dissolution rate. Both these techniques play a significant role in improving drug solubility and performance.</p></p>
