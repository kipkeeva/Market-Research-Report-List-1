<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Electrical Steel Sheets Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Oriented Electrical Steel</li><li>Non-oriented Electrical Steel</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Electrical steel sheets are classified into two main types: oriented electrical steel and non-oriented electrical steel. Oriented electrical steel is a type of electrical steel that has been carefully manufactured to possess a preferred magnetic direction. This makes it highly efficient for use in transformers, electric motors, and generators. On the other hand, non-oriented electrical steel does not possess a preferred magnetic direction and is used in applications where the magnetic properties need to be isotropic, such as in electric appliances and rotating machinery.</p></p>
