<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Aircraft Tow Tractor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Conventional Tractors</li><li>Towbarless Tractors</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The aircraft tow tractor market comprises two types of tractors: conventional tractors and towbarless tractors. Conventional tractors are equipped with a conventional towbar system, requiring the attachment of the towbar to the nose landing gear of the aircraft. They are used for towing smaller aircraft and are more affordable. Towbarless tractors, on the other hand, eliminate the need for a towbar as they have built-in lifting devices. They can tow a wider range of aircraft and are more efficient, but also more expensive than conventional tractors.</p></p>
