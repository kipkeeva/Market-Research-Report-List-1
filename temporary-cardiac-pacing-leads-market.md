<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Temporary Cardiac Pacing Leads Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Unipolar</li><li>Bipolar</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Temporary cardiac pacing leads are used in patients who require temporary pacing support. There are two main types: unipolar and bipolar. Unipolar leads consist of a single electrode positioned near the heart, with the electrical current returning to an external electrode on the patient's skin. Bipolar leads, on the other hand, have two closely spaced electrodes near the heart, allowing the electrical current to flow between them. Both types have their advantages and are used based on the patient's specific needs and the medical professional's judgment.</p></p>
