<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Passenger Car Brake Caliper Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single Piston Caliper</li><li>Multi-Piston Caliper</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The passenger car brake caliper market is classified into two types: single piston caliper and multi-piston caliper. A single piston caliper consists of one piston located on one side of the caliper, which applies pressure to the brake pads. This type of caliper is less complex and generally used in standard passenger cars. On the other hand, a multi-piston caliper has multiple pistons, usually on both sides of the caliper, providing more balanced braking force distribution. Multi-piston calipers are typically found in high-performance cars and provide better braking performance and stability.</p></p>
