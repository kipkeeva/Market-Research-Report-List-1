<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Angiographic Guidewire Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>PTFE Coated</li><li>Uncoated</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The angiographic guidewire market is divided into two types: PTFE coated and uncoated wires. PTFE coated guidewires are covered with a thin layer of polytetrafluoroethylene, a non-stick and low-friction material. This coating reduces friction during insertion and provides smooth navigation within blood vessels. On the other hand, uncoated guidewires lack this protective layer but offer a more cost-effective option for certain procedures. Both types have their own applications and advantages, depending on the specific needs of the patient and the procedure being performed.</p></p>
