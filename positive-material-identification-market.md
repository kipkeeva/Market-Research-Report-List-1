<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Positive Material Identification Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>XRF</li><li>OES</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Positive Material Identification (PMI) is a technique used to identify the composition of materials in various industries. Two common methods used in PMI are X-ray fluorescence (XRF) and optical emission spectroscopy (OES). XRF utilizes X-ray radiation to excite the atoms in a sample, causing them to emit characteristic fluorescent X-rays, which are then detected and analyzed to determine the material composition. OES, on the other hand, uses a high-energy spark or plasma to excite the atoms, producing characteristic emission spectra that are analyzed to identify the elements present in the sample.</p></p>
