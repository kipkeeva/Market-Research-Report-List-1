<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Twin-clutch Transmission Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Wet Multiplate Clutches</li><li>Dry Single-Plate Clutches</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Twin-clutch transmission is a type of gearbox used in vehicles. It consists of two separate clutches, allowing for efficient and smooth gear changes. There are two main types of clutches used in twin-clutch transmissions: wet multiplate clutches and dry single-plate clutches. Wet multiplate clutches utilize oil to cool and lubricate the clutch plates, ensuring better heat dissipation and durability. On the other hand, dry single-plate clutches do not use oil and are more simple and economical in design, although they may be less efficient in dissipating heat.</p></p>
