<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Peristaltic Pumps for Pharmaceuticals Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Roller Peristaltic Pump</li><li>Shoe type Peristaltic Pump</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Peristaltic pumps are commonly used in the pharmaceutical industry for transporting fluids without coming into direct contact with the pump itself. Roller peristaltic pumps consist of rotating rollers that squeeze a flexible tube, creating a vacuum to draw the fluid through. Conversely, shoe type peristaltic pumps use a flexible shoe that compresses the tube to move the fluid forward. Both types are widely used in pharmaceutical applications due to their ability to provide accurate and sterile fluid transfer, ensuring product safety and integrity.</p></p>
