<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Passenge Vehicle Airbag Inflator Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Pyrotechnic Inflator</li><li>Stored Gas Inflator</li><li>Hybrid Inflator</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The Passenger Vehicle Airbag Inflator market consists of three types: Pyrotechnic Inflator, Stored Gas Inflator, and Hybrid Inflator. Pyrotechnic Inflators use a small explosive charge to rapidly inflate the airbag during a collision. Stored Gas Inflators store compressed gas, usually nitrogen, to inflate the airbag. Lastly, Hybrid Inflators combine pyrotechnic and stored gas technologies, utilizing both an explosive charge and compressed gas to inflate the airbag. These different types of inflators serve the same purpose of swiftly deploying the airbag to protect passengers in the event of a crash.</p></p>

<p><ul><li>Curtain airbags</li><li>Frontal airbags</li><li>Knee airbags</li><li>External airbags</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Curtain airbags, frontal airbags, knee airbags, and external airbags are all types of passenger vehicle airbag inflators used for safety purposes. Curtain airbags provide protection to the heads of occupants in the event of a side-impact collision. Frontal airbags are designed to deploy in frontal impacts, protecting the driver and front-seat passenger from severe injuries. Knee airbags are meant to prevent leg and knee injuries in frontal crashes. External airbags, a relatively new technology, are installed on the outside of the vehicle to provide additional protection in side-impact accidents.</p></p>
