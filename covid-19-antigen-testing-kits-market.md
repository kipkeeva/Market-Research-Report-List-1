<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The COVID 19 Antigen Testing Kits Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>PCR</li><li>Qpcr</li></ul></p>
<p><p>COVID-19 antigen testing kits are essential in diagnosing the presence of the virus in individuals. PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) and qPCR (Quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction) are two types of testing kits used in the market. PCR testing detects and amplifies the viral genetic material through a series of heating and cooling cycles. This amplification allows for accurate diagnosis. On the other hand, qPCR quantifies the amount of viral genetic material present in a sample, providing more detailed information. Both PCR and qPCR play a crucial role in the effective detection and monitoring of COVID-19 cases.</p></p>
