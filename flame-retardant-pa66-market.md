<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Flame Retardant PA66 Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Halogen Type</li><li>Halogen Free Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The flame retardant PA66 market is categorized into two types: halogen type and halogen-free type. Halogen type flame retardants contain halogen elements, such as chlorine or bromine, which release flame-inhibiting gases when exposed to fire. These gases interfere with the combustion process and reduce the spread of flames. On the other hand, halogen-free type flame retardants do not contain halogen elements. They achieve flame resistance through alternative mechanisms, such as creating a protective barrier or releasing non-toxic gases. Both types of flame retardants are used to enhance the fire safety of PA66 materials.</p></p>
