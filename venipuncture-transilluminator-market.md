<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Venipuncture Transilluminator Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Infrared</li><li>Infrared Fluorescence</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Venipuncture Transilluminator is a medical device used to locate veins for drawing blood or administering intravenous therapy. There are two types of transilluminator technologies: Infrared and Infrared Fluorescence. Infrared transilluminators emit infrared light that is absorbed by hemoglobin, making veins more visible. Infrared Fluorescence transilluminators use a fluorescent dye injected into the patient's bloodstream, causing the veins to emit a fluorescent glow when exposed to infrared light. Both types enhance vein detection, aiding healthcare professionals in performing venipuncture procedures more accurately and efficiently.</p></p>
