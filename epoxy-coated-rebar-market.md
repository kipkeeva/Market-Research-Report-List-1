<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Epoxy-Coated Rebar Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Deformed Steel</li><li>Mild Steel</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The epoxy-coated rebar market encompasses two main types: deformed steel and mild steel. Deformed steel rebar is characterized by the presence of ribs, bumps, or indentations along its length, which enhances its bonding with concrete. On the other hand, mild steel rebar has a smooth surface without any deformations. Both types are coated with epoxy to provide corrosion protection, increasing their lifespan and durability. Epoxy coating acts as a barrier against moisture and chemicals, significantly reducing the risk of rust and structural damage in reinforced concrete structures.</p></p>
