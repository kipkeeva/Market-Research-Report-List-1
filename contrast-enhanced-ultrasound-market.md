<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Contrast-Enhanced Ultrasound Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Non-targeted contrast-enhanced ultrasound</li><li>Targeted contrast-enhanced ultrasound</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) is a medical imaging technique that uses ultrasound and contrast agents to enhance the visibility of blood vessels and organs in the body. CEUS can be classified into two types: non-targeted and targeted. Non-targeted CEUS involves the use of contrast agents that enhance the overall image without specifically targeting a particular area. On the other hand, targeted CEUS utilizes contrast agents that are designed to bind to specific molecules or structures, allowing for a more precise and focused imaging of certain regions or diseases.</p></p>
