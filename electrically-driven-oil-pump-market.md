<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Electrically Driven Oil Pump Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Integrated Pump</li><li>Separate Pump</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The electrically driven oil pump market comprises two types: integrated pump and separate pump. In an integrated pump system, the oil pump is directly mounted onto the engine, making it a compact and space-saving solution. On the other hand, a separate pump system consists of an individual pump unit that is separate from the engine and is connected through hoses or pipes. Both types offer efficient and reliable oil circulation in various applications, such as automotive, industrial machinery, and power generation.</p></p>
