<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Mineral-based Adjuvants Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Aluminum Compounds</li><li>Calcium Phosphate Adjuvants</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Mineral-based adjuvants are substances used in vaccines to enhance their effectiveness. Aluminum compounds and calcium phosphate adjuvants are two common types. Aluminum compounds, such as aluminum hydroxide and aluminum phosphate, stimulate a stronger immune response by forming an antigen depot at the injection site. Calcium phosphate adjuvants, like calcium phosphate nanoparticles, can improve vaccine stability and increase antigen uptake by immune cells, leading to a better immune response. Both types play a crucial role in enhancing the efficacy of vaccines and improving immune protection against infectious diseases.</p></p>
