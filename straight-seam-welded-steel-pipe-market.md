<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Straight Seam Welded Steel Pipe Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>JCOE Process</li><li>UOE Process</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Straight seam welded steel pipes are commonly manufactured using two processes: JCOE process and UOE process. In the JCOE process, plates are bent into a U-shape and then formed into an O-shape before being finally expanded and welded into a straight seam pipe. On the other hand, the UOE process involves first forming a U-shaped plate, followed by expanding it and then finally welding it into a straight seam pipe. Both processes result in high-quality welded steel pipes used in various applications such as oil and gas transportation.</p></p>
